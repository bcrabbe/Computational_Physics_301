=================================

3rd year Computational Physics assignments.

Exercise 1 - numerical matrix inversion algorithms.
Exercise 2 - numerical solutions to partial differential equations.
Exercise 3 - methods and applications of random variable transformations.

For each exercise there is the problem we were set, a number of programs I wrote to solve these problems, and a report written by meself explaining and analysing the solutions.
